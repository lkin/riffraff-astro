Read the street.</strong></p><p>We are Riff-Raff: a new research outfit driven by an obsession with the extra mile that most agencies refuse to walk. We trade the boardroom for the back alley, the focus group for the dive bar, the cliches of the expat for the wisdom of locals. Through narratives written with ambition and precision, we translate the overwhelming reality of social life in Japan into actionable insight to guide your decisionmaking process. We don't just give you findings; we give you the Japan that exists when the meeting ends.</p>",
